### NBA Adjusted Plus-Minus (APM)

Estimate player on-court impact from NBA play-by-play using an adjusted plus‑minus model (regularized regression over possession‑level stints).
This repo contains a minimal pipeline to:
1. parse & label play‑by‑play
2. reconstruct lineups by possession
3. build a regression design matrix
4. fit an APM model to produce per‑player coefficients.

## Contents

# Pipeline
label_play_by_play.py – Labels raw play‑by‑play with possessions, outcomes, and possession boundaries.
get_lineups.py – Reconstructs on‑court lineups at the possession level.
aggregate_plus_minus_data.py – Builds the regression design: one column per player, with data on point differential, number of possessions, off/def rating.
regression.py – Fits the adjusted plus‑minus model (ridge regularization by default) and exports coefficients.

# Inspecting the data
analyze_play_by_play.ipynb – Exploratory notebook for sanity checks and visualization of the labeling logic.

# Data
player_coefficients.csv – Output data with player coeffficients, standard errors and possession sample size (generated by regression.py).
data/ – Data directory with lineups and their point differentials (generated by aggregate_plus_minus_data.py).

## What is Adjusted Plus‑Minus (APM)?
APM estimates a player’s contribution to the team’s scoring margin while controlling for teammates, opponents, and other contextual effects by solving a regression over on‑court indicator variables. Because lineups can be collinear and data noisy, ridge regularization is commonly used to stabilize the solution. This repository implements a simple, transparent version of that idea.
